/* Key Insights:
ðŸš€ The AI/ML Premium Revolution
The most striking finding is that AI and machine learning skills dominate the highest salary tiers:

PyTorch leads at $125K (33% premium) - Deep learning expertise is now premium-tier
TensorFlow at $121K (29% premium) - Traditional ML framework still valuable
Perl at $125K (33% premium) - Surprising legacy language value for data processing

This represents a major evolution from your foundational analysis - while SQL/Python are essential foundations, AI/ML specialization is where the premium dollars are.
ðŸ“ˆ The Demand vs. Premium Paradox
Unlike foundational skills that follow demand patterns, premium skills show an interesting inverse relationship:

High-demand skills (Snowflake: 240 jobs, Spark: 186 jobs) offer solid but moderate premiums (17-19%)
Niche specialist skills (Cassandra: 11 jobs, Neo4j: 12 jobs) command much higher premiums (26%+)

ðŸ’¡ Strategic Career Evolution Path
Phase 4 (Premium Specialization) - Building on your SQL+Python+Tableau foundation:

AI/ML Track: Add PyTorch or TensorFlow to your Python skills

Potential salary jump: $95K â†’ $125K (32% increase)
Market positioning: Data Scientist vs. Data Analyst


Big Data Architecture: Combine Spark + Kafka + Airflow

Creates a $112-123K salary bracket
High job availability (300+ combined positions)


Cloud Data Platforms: Specialize in Snowflake + Databricks

Most job opportunities (342 combined positions)
Steady $110-113K salaries with growth potential



ðŸŽ¯ The "Golden Trifecta" Strategy
Based on both analyses, the optimal progression is:

Foundation: SQL + Python (your 22.70% power combo)
Visualization: Add Tableau (proven 17.52% combination)
Premium Specialization: Choose one premium track (AI/ML, Big Data, or Cloud)

This creates a compound premium effect - you're not just adding skills, you're creating a unique value proposition that combines foundational competency with premium specialization.
